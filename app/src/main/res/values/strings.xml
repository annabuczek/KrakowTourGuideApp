    <string name="home_fragment_overview"><b>KRAKÓW</b>
        \n
        \nKraków, also spelled Cracow or Krakow is the second
        largest and one of the oldest cities in Poland. Situated on the Vistula River
        (Polish: Wisła) in the Lesser Poland (Polish: Małopolska) region, the city dates back
        to the 7th century.\n
        \nKraków has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Polish
        academic, cultural and artistic life and is one of Poland\'s most important economic hubs.
        It was the capital of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland from 1038 to 1569.\n
        \nThe city has grown from a Stone Age settlement to Poland\'s second most important city.
        It began as a hamlet on Wawel Hill and was already being reported as a busy trading
        centre of Slavonic Europe in 965. With the establishment of new universities and
        cultural venues at the emergence of the Second Polish Republic in 1918 and throughout
        the 20th century, Kraków reaffirmed its role as a major national academic and artistic
        centre.\n
        \nKraków is home to Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in
        the world and traditionally Poland\'s most reputable institution of higher learning.\n
        \nIn 2000, Kraków was named European Capital of Culture. In 2013 Kraków was officially
        approved as a UNESCO City of Literature. It is also a global city with the ranking
        of high sufficiency by GaWC. Cited as one of Europe\'s most beautiful cities,
        as well as one of the most unique destinations in the world. The city hosted
        the World Youth Day in July 2016.</string>

    <string name="home_fragment_info"><b>GEOGRAPHY</b>
        \n
        \nKraków lies in the southern part of Poland, on the Vistula River, in a valley at the
        foot of the Carpathian Mountains, 219 m above sea level, halfway between the Jurassic
        Rock Upland (Polish: Jura Krakowsko-Częstochowska) to the north, and the Tatra Mountains
        100 km to the south, constituting the natural border with Slovakia and the Czech Republic,
        230 km west from the border with Ukraine.
        \n
        \n<b>CLIMATE</b>
        \n
        \nKraków has a humid continental climate according to the Köppen climate classification system,
        which can be classified as an oceanic climate. Average temperatures in summer range from
        17.0 to 19.2 °C and in winter from −2.0 to −0.6 °C.
        \n
        \n<b>PARKS AND GARDENS</b>
        \n
        \nThere are about 40 parks in Kraków including dozens of gardens and forests.
        Several, like the Planty Park, Botanical Garden, Park Krakowski, Jordan Park and Błonia Park
        are located in the centre of the city with Zakrzówek, Lasek Wolski forest, Strzelecki Park
        and Park Lotników (among others) in the surrounding districts.
        \n
        \n<b>DISTRICTS</b>
        \n
        \nKraków is divided into 18 administrative districts (dzielnica) or boroughs,
        each with a degree of autonomy within its own municipal government. Prior to March 1991,
        the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków
        – the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta, and Krowodrza which were amalgamated into the city
        of Kraków as it expanded, and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.
        \n
        \n<b>ECONOMY</b>
        \n
        \nKraków is one of Poland\'s most important economic centres and the economic hub of the
        Lesser Poland (Małopolska) region. Since the fall of communism, the private sector has
        been growing steadily. There are about 50 large multinational companies in the city,
        including Google, IBM, Royal Dutch Shell, Motorola, Delphi, MAN SE, General Electric,
        ABB, Aon Hewitt, Cisco Systems Hitachi, Philip Morris, Capgemini, and Sabre Holdings,
        along with other British, German and Scandinavian-based firms. The city is also the global
        headquarters for Comarch, a Polish enterprise software house.
        \n
        \n<b>POPULATION</b>
        \n
        \nThe city has a population of approximately 760,000, with approximately 8 million additional
        people living within a 100 km radius of its main square.
        \n
        \n<b>RELIGION</b>
        \n
        \nThe metropolitan city of Kraków is known as the city of churches. The abundance of landmark,
        historic temples along with the plenitude of monasteries and convents earned the city a
        countrywide reputation as the \"Northern Rome\" in the past. The churches of Kraków comprise
        over 120 places of worship (2007) of which over 65 were built in the 20th century.
        More are still being added. In addition to Roman Catholicism, other denominations present
        include Jehovah\'s Witnesses, Mariavite Church, Polish Catholic Church, Polish Orthodox
        Church, Protestantism and Latter-Day Saints.
        \n
        \n<b>CULTURE</b>
        \n
        \nKraków was named the official European Capital of Culture for the year 2000 by the
        European Union. It is a major attraction for both local and international tourists,
        attracting seven million visitors a year. Major landmarks include the Main Market Square
        with St. Mary\'s Basilica and the Sukiennice Cloth Hall, the Wawel Castle, the National Art
        Museum, the Zygmunt Bell at the Wawel Cathedral, and the medieval St Florian\'s Gate with
        the Barbican along the Royal Coronation Route. Kraków has 28 museums and public art galleries.
        Among them is the National Museum featuring works by Leonardo da Vinci and Rembrandt.
        \n
        \n<b>TOURISM</b>
        \n
        \nAccording to recent official statistics, in 2016 Kraków was visited by over 12 million
        tourists including 2.9 million foreign travelers.
        Most foreign tourists came from Great Britain, followed by German, Italian, Portuguese,
        Spanish, Canadian and American visitors.

    <string name="top1_title">Wawel Castle</string>
    <string name="top1_description_short">Royal Castle on Wawel Hill</string>
    <string name="top1_description">The Wawel Castle is a castle residency located in central Kraków,
        Poland. Built at the behest of King Casimir III the Great, it consists of a number of
        structures situated around the Italian-styled main courtyard.
        The castle, being one of the largest in Poland, represents nearly all European architectural
        styles of medieval, renaissance and baroque periods. The Wawel Royal Castle and the Wawel
        Hill constitute the most historically and culturally significant site in the country.
        In 1978 it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Historic Centre of Kraków.
        \nFor centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood,
        the Castle is now one of the country’s premier art museums.
        Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for
        collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings,
        prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection,
        goldsmith’s work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture.
        The museum’s holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents
        in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important
        center for the conservation of works of art.</string>

    <string name="top2_description_short">The center of the city</string>
    <string name="top2_description">The main square (Polish: Rynek Główny) of the Old Town of Kraków,
        Lesser Poland, is the principal urban space located at the center of the city.
        It dates back to the 13th century, and at 3.79 ha is one of the largest medieval town
        squares in Europe. The Project for Public Spaces (PPS) lists the square as the best
        public space in Europe due to its lively street life, and it was a major factor in the
        inclusion of Kraków as one of the top off-the-beaten-path destinations in the world in 2016.
        \nThe main square is a square space surrounded by historic townhouses (kamienice) and
        churches. The center of the square is dominated by the Cloth Hall (Sukiennice),
        rebuilt in 1555 in the Renaissance style, topped by a beautiful attic or Polish parapet
        decorated with carved masks. On one side of the cloth hall is the Town Hall Tower
        (Wieża ratuszowa), on the other the 10th century Church of St. Adalbert and 1898
        Adam Mickiewicz Monument. Rising above the square are the Gothic towers of St. Mary's
        Basilica (Kościół Mariacki). Kraków Main Square does not have a town hall, because
        it has not survived to the present day.</string>

    <string name="top3_description">Church of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven (also known as Saint Mary\'s Church;
        Polish: Kościół Wniebowzięcia Najświętszej Maryi Panny, Kościół Mariacki) is a
        Brick Gothic church adjacent to the Main Market Square in Kraków, Poland.
        Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve
        as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m
        tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz).
        \nOn every hour, a trumpet signal—called the Hejnał mariacki—is played from the top of
        the taller of Saint Mary\'s two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid-stream,
        to commemorate the famous 13th century trumpeter, who was shot in the throat while
        sounding the alarm before the Mongol attack on the city. The noon-time hejnał is heard
        across Poland and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.</string>

        Opened in the 13th century, the mine produced table salt continuously until 2007, as one of
        the world\'s oldest salt mines in operation. Throughout, the royal mine was run by the
        Żupy krakowskie Salt Mines company.
        \nCommercial mining was discontinued in 1996, because of salt prices going down and also
        mine flooding. The mine is currently one of Poland\'s official national Historic Monuments
        (Pomniki historii), whose attractions include dozens of statues and four chapels

    <string name="top5_description">Kazimierz is a historical district of Kraków and Kraków Old Town,
        Poland. Since its inception in the fourteenth century to the early nineteenth century,
        Kazimierz was an independent city, a royal city of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom,
        located south of Kraków Old Town and separated by a branch of the Vistula river.
        For many centuries, Kazimierz was a place of coexistence and interpenetration of ethnic
        Polish and Jewish cultures, its north-eastern part of the district was historic Jewish,
        whose Jewish inhabitants were forcibly relocated in 1941 by the German occupying forces
        into the Krakow ghetto just across the river in Podgórze. Today Kazimierz is one of the
        major tourist attractions of Krakow and an important center of cultural life of the city.
        \nThe boundaries of Kazimierz are defined by an old island in the Vistula river.
        The northern branch of the river (Stara Wisła – Old Vistula) was filled-in at the end of
        the 19th century during the partitions of Poland and made into an extension of ul. Stradomska
        Street connecting Kazimierz district with Kraków Old Town.</string>

    <string name="activity3_description">To give you at least a basic idea of how the laws of nature
        are learned in the Experience Garden, we invite you for a quick journey to your imagination.
        After crossing the gate of the Garden and buying tickets, we go deeper into the Garden.
        The first station is a prism, transforming sunlight into a beautiful rainbow. It is dozens
        of times larger than school prisms, made of plexiglas and filled with glycerine.
        After white prism dispersion we advise you to set towards the Newton disc, where an opposite
        effect can be obtained. The disc, colourful when not moving, becomes white at 1800
        rotations per minute. Like in the popular toy, the mirrors are inclined at 60 degrees,
        but there are no colourful glasses. We take their place. We are the object mirrored
        multiple times. If there was no occasion so far, we check the looks of the back of our
        head to see if the hairdresser performs as expected. Let us go farther, one cannot
        stay to long in a crowd of look-alikes. The world gets stranger and stranger, and it is
        only the beginning. Every device presents one or more physical phenomena, never obtained
        just by pressing the button and watching. A gong struck strongly will emit no interesting
        sound, but multiple, subtle strikes lead to acoustic waves adding to create an
        incredible mood. At another station we can create a whirlpool and watch its unique
        behaviour, dependent on the speed of cranking. Considering the way of leaving such a
        whirlpool may prove invaluable.</string>

    <string name="around1_description_short">Tragic history of the II Word War</string>
    <string name="around1_description">Auschwitz concentration camp was a network of concentration
        and extermination camps built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World
        War II. It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original concentration camp), Auschwitz II–Birkenau
        (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz III–Monowitz (a labor camp to
        staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. Auschwitz was first constructed to
        hold Polish political prisoners, who began to arrive in May 1940. The first extermination
        of prisoners took place in September 1941. Auschwitz II–Birkenau went on to become a
        major site of the Nazis\' Final Solution to the Jewish Question during the Holocaust.
        From early 1942 until late 1944, transport trains delivered Jews to the camp\'s gas chambers
        from all over German-occupied Europe, where they were killed en masse with the
        cyanide-based poison Zyklon B, originally developed to be used as a pesticide.
        An estimated 1.3 million people were sent to the camp, of whom at least 1.1 million died.
        Around 90 percent of those were Jews; approximately one in six Jews killed in the Holocaust
        died at the camp. Others deported to Auschwitz included 150,000 Poles, 23,000
        Romani and Sinti, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 400 Jehovah's Witnesses, and
        tens of thousands of others of diverse nationalities, including an unknown number of
        homosexuals. Many of those not killed in the gas chambers died of starvation, forced labor,
        infectious diseases, individual executions, and medical experiments.</string>

    <string name="event1_description">The Long Night of Museums (or the Night of Museums) is a
        cultural event in which museums and cultural institutions in an area cooperate to remain open
        late into the night to introduce themselves to new potential patrons. Visitors are given a
        common entrance pass which grants them access to all exhibits as well as complimentary
        public transportation within the area. The first Long Night of Museums took place in
        Berlin in 1997. The concept has been very well received, and since then the number of
        participating institutions and exhibitions has risen dramatically, spreading
        to over 120 other cities throughout Europe, as well as elsewhere,
        in Argentina and the Philippines.</string>

    <string name="sight4_title">Wawel Dragon statue</string>
    <string name="sight4_description_short">Monument at the foot of the Wawel Hill in Kraków</string>
    <string name="sight4_description">Wawel Dragon is a famous dragon in Polish mythology who lived
        in a cave at the foot of Wawel Hill on the banks of the Vistula River. One of the many
        popular stories about the dragon takes place in Kraków during the reign of King Krakus,
        the city\'s mythical founder. In the legend, the dragon terrifies local villagers by
        destroying their houses and eating up their young daughters. Desperate to solve the
        problem, King Krakus promises his daughter Wanda\'s hand to any brave man who can defeat
        the dragon. A cobbler named Skuba takes up the challenge and stuffs a lamb with
        sulphur for the dragon to eat. Skuba leaves the lamb near the dragon cave and the unwary
        beast devours the bait. Soon after, the dragon\'s thirst grows unbearable and he drinks
        so much water from the River Vistula that he explodes from the uncontainable volume.
        King Krakus then weds his daughter Wanda to the victorious Skuba. In the oldest, 12th
        century version of this tale, written by Wincenty Kadłubek, dragon was defeated by two sons
        of a King Krak, Krakus II and Lech II.</string>
